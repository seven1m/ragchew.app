<h1>Create a Net</h1>

<% if @my_clubs.any? %>
  <p>
    You are about to start a net. Only do this if you absolutely know what you are doing.
    If you are trying to participate in a net or join a net or call into a net, this is not
    where you do that. Instead, go back <a href="/">home</a> and find the net there.
    If it's not there, then whoever is responsible for running and/or logging the net hasn't
    started it yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Do not continue unless you are a person in charge of this net!</strong>
  </p>

  <p class="warning-callout">
    <strong>This is a BETA feature.</strong> It is very likely you will encounter bugs,
    and if you're lucky they won't be the kind of bugs that eat your net and all your ham buddies.
    If you aren't willing to be embarrassed by bad software, please don't use this feature (yet).
    If, on the other hand, you want to help me work out the kinks, carry on, friend!
